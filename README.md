# Rimworld ZPM (Zero-Point Module)

The Archotech ZPM slowly converts Dark Energy into electricity, for free, but has an outsided capacity of 20,000 Watts.
It also steadily draws power from the Zero-Point Energy Field and stores it a highly charged pocket of subspace.

It is capable of powering an entire settlement for days on end..

**ALERT: The transdimensional conduits of the ZPM can have *devastating* consequences for all higher lifeforms on the map!** 
        
It is highly recommended that you do not allow it to get above 75% full capacity.

Non Steam Downloads and GitHub Repositories of this mod is available at: https://github.com/BetterRimworlds/Archotech-ZPM/

If you already have the BetterRimworld's Stargate mod, you will be able to research how to build your own ZPMs, at a considerable
cost. See https://github.com/BetterRimworlds/Rimworld-Stargate

**Warning:** The ZPM manipulates the very fundamental basis of the space/time reality construct. Use it at your own risk!

Because of this there may be adverse effects. The main danger that you *will* experience, at about once every 3-5 years, 
is that if the Dark Energy Reserve gets above 80%, you are at risk for a huge *explosion* anywhere along the connected grid.
If the explosion occurs inside, it will usually instantly kill any pawn within 5-6 tiles and, at full 25,000+25,000 capacitance,
ignite a fireball of about 10-15 tiles in diameter, instantly raising indoor tempatures to > 2,000 F and igniting everything --
and everyone -- in the vicinity. Fire poppers are mandatory.

When used in conjunction with the Stargate, you will NOT need to wait to charge the Stargate (~20,000 kW), and in the future,
it will also allow intergalactic wormhole travel (e.g., across our Internet).

This mod also adds an Artifacts Orbital Trade Ship, which specializes in Archotech of all kinds, including previously non-buyable
artifacts, such as the Venometric Battery (which also sucks 1,000 w from the Zero-Point Field).

The Zero-Point Energy Field is very real. Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy for more.
