# Rimworld ZPM (Zero-Point Module)
**Warning:** The ZPM manipulates the very fundamental basis of the space/time reality construct. Use it at your own risk!

Because of this there may be adverse effects. The main danger that you *will* experience, at about once every 3-5 years, 
is that if the Dark Energy Reserve gets above 80%, you are at risk for a huge *explosion* anywhere along the connected grid.
If the explosion occurs inside, it will usually instantly kill any pawn within 5-6 tiles and, at full 25,000+25,000 capacitance,
ignite a fireball of about 10-15 tiles in diameter, instantly raising indoor tempatures to > 2,000 F and igniting everything --
and everyone -- in the vicinity. Fire poppers are mandatory.

When used in conjunction with the Stargate, you will NOT need to wait to charge the Stargate (~20,000 kW), and in the future,
it will also allow intergalactic wormhole travel (e.g., across our Internet).

This mod also adds an Artifacts Orbital Trade Ship, which specializes in Archotech of all kinds, including previously non-buyable
artifacts, such as the Venometric Battery (which also sucks 1,000 w from the Zero-Point Field).

The Zero-Point Energy Field is very real. Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy for more.
