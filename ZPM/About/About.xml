    <description>Version: 1.0.0
The Archotech ZPM slowly converts Dark Energy into electricity, for free, but has an outsided capacity of 20,000 Watts.
You can manually dictate how much power it draws from your grid or sends out. It is also EMP shielded and works during
solar flares.

**ALERT: The transdimensional conduits of the ZPM can have *devastating* consequences for all higher lifeforms on the map!** 
        
It is highly recommended that you do not allow it to get above 75% full capacity.

If you already have the BetterRimworld's Stargate mod, you will be able to research how to build your own ZPMs, at a considerable
cost. See https://github.com/BetterRimworlds/Rimworld-Stargate
